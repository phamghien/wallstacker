Easy-to-learn, classic stacker-style game designed to keep players coming back to compete for the high score. The goal of this mini-game is to stack Sage's wall. With each time a wall is placed, the next round is slightly faster. Eventually, players will have to put their reflexes to the test to see if they can place the wall at a difficult speed. 

## How to Play
Press the space bar to stack the wall as high as you can.
